# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and visualization.

## Structure

```
notebooks/
├── exploration/   # Data exploration notebooks
├── analysis/      # Model analysis notebooks
└── visualization/ # Plotting and visualization
```

## Guidelines

- Keep notebooks focused and well-documented
- Clear outputs before committing (or use `nbstripout`)
- Export important findings to markdown/docs
- Use `nbconvert` to generate reports

## Best Practices

- Start with `01_explore_data.ipynb`
- Document assumptions and findings
- Keep code reproducible (set seeds, document versions)
