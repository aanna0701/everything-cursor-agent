# Git Workflow

Use when creating pull requests or planning feature implementation. Commit message format (conventional commits) is defined in always-apply.

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft a clear PR summary
4. Include a test plan
5. Push with `-u` if new branch

## Feature Implementation Flow

1. **Plan first** — Break down into phases, identify dependencies and risks.
2. **TDD** — Use the **tdd-workflow** skill: write tests first, then implement, then refactor; aim for 80%+ coverage.
3. **Review** — After writing code, run tests and address issues; use **coding-standards** and **security-review** skills when relevant.
4. **Commit & push** — Use conventional commits (see always-apply) and small, focused commits.
