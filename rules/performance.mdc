# Performance and Workflow (Cursor)

Use when planning how to use the agent or manage context. Test/lint commands are in always-apply.

## Context and Scope

- Prefer smaller, focused tasks when possible (single-file edits, one feature at a time).
- For large refactors or multi-file features, break into clear steps and use a todo list so the agent can track progress.

## Task Breakdown

- Use a short checklist or todo list for multi-step work.
- Verify each step before moving on (run tests, lint, typecheck).

## Build and Test Failures

When builds or tests fail:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Fix incrementally
3. Re-run after each change
