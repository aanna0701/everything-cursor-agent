# General

- All file contents must be written in English only (code, comments, documentation, generated files, examples).

# When Asked to Implement a Feature or Behavior

- Write the implementation in Python.
- Install required packages using uv (e.g. `uv add <pkg>` or `uv pip install <pkg>`).
- Provide clear run instructions (e.g. `uv run python ...`) and a minimal example or test to reproduce.
- Clean up temporary scripts or intermediate artifacts after implementation.
- All generated code, comments, and auxiliary files in English.

# Code Style (All Projects)

- **Type hints** on all functions.
- **pathlib** for paths; no raw string paths or `os.path` for new code.
- **logging** instead of print; use `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
- Prefer **small files**: 200–400 lines typical, 600 max; high cohesion, one class/concept per file; organize by feature/domain.
- Prefer **immutability**: frozen dataclasses for configs, create new dicts instead of mutating.
- Use **dataclasses** (or Pydantic) for configuration, not bare dicts.
- **Conventional commits**: `<type>: <description>` with types `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`.
- When a project has `.cursor/rules`, follow them. Use `~/.cursor/skills` when relevant (e.g. **tdd-workflow** for new features, **security-review** for auth/APIs, **coding-standards** for style).
- After making changes, verify with tests and lint as needed: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run pyright`.

# When Asked to Draft Documentation

- Extract from code comments first; analyze README.md for purpose, usage, structure, run steps.
- Generate Markdown with: Overview, Install, Usage, Structure, Examples (if possible). All in English.

# When Asked to Refactor

- Make all code comments English; add/normalize type hints; preserve existing behavior unless requested otherwise; summarize changes and key diffs.

# When Asked to Create a New Project

- Generate README.md by default; propose a sensible structure and minimal runnable example; use uv for dependencies; include run/test/lint briefly. All generated files in English.
